After 5 days of being alone, going for jogs, taking certain brain supplements, doing lots of analog tasks, stay the
minimum on my phone, taking care of myself and surroundings, I feel how I felt 15 years ago... just happy, curious, and satisfied.

I can't turn it into words, but it's the best feeling ever.

(prior to that I have been doing must except exercise and brain supplements and lots of analog tasks)

Leaving alone and taking care of myself might be the answer. Will share in future logs.
